<!-- //1. Create a new variable called "timeRemaining" and give it a value of 600


//2. Create a new variable called "recordedTimes" which is an array with nothing in it


//3. Write a for loop that runs 10 times and each time it runs subtracts 60 from the timeRemaining variable and adds the current value of timeRemaining to the recordedTimes array


//4. Cause the "recordedTimes" array to be logged to the console


//5. If the value of the "timeRemaining" variable is less than 0 log "you’re out of time..." to the console; otherwise log "you’ve made it!"


//6. Create a new variable called "stats" which is an empty object




//7a. Define a function named "getStats" which does the following:
//7b. Specifies two parameters as "statsObj" (which is an object) and "numbersArr" (which is an array) that will be accepted as arguments
//7c. Loops through the "numbersArr" array with a for loop, which finds the smallest number and stores the value in a property called "smallestNum" on "statsObj"
//7d. Loops through the "numbersArr" array with a while loop, which adds all the numbers together into a variable called "arrTotal"
//7e. Divide "arrTotal" by the total number of items in "numbersArr" (this number should be obtained using JavaScript, not hard-coded) and store the value in a property called "averageNum" on "statsObj"
//7f. Return "statsObj"




//8. Call the "getStats" function and assign the returned value into a new variable called “testStats”. Pass in the "stats" and "recordedTimes" variables as arguments.


//9. Console log the values of the "smallestNum" and "averageNum" properties of the returned object in the format: "The smallest number is ## and the average of all the numbers is ##"
